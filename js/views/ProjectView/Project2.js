          <h3>Solutions</h3>
          <p>Based on the result of comparative analysis, we decide to approach the problem using both digital and physical solutions. that is building a physical navigational device that would be powered by a digital app.</p>
          <img src={img1} />
          <div className='project-layout-half'>
            <div>
              <b>Cycnav Navigational App</b>: The app uses googles map api to calculate the best route for the users, use can also input their finding of road conditions using the app.
            </div>
            <div>
              <b>Cycnav Bike Light</b>: The bike light is connected to the app using bluetooth. While the app is calculating and adjusting the route,
              the bike light functions as the visual portal to help guide the cyclists while they are biking.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Wireframes - Digital</h3>
          <p>
              We started by creating several different versions of wireframes. The focus of the wireframe is to help the user find the route of their destination. Then leads them to the bike light.
            </p>
          <p>
            the features of the app: <br />
            <ul>
              <li>Search for destination </li>
              <li>Find the desired route </li>
              <li>Initiate navigation </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <img src={img11} />

          <h3>Prototype - Bike Light </h3>
          <p>Once the user has done deciding on the route, we would like them to put away their phone and use the bike light to navigate. We used Revit to do the modeling of the bikelight, the main idea is to have a fluid shape of a light that canbe easily attached </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Serves the core functioanl requirements: Feeding and receiving data to the phone, Major biking light, indicational lights</li>
            <li>Fluid shape that can be easily attached to the bike, and easily dettached for charging</li>
            <li>Secure enough for threfting </li>
          </ul>
          <div className='project-layout-third'>
            <div> prototype 1 </div>
            <div> prototype 2 </div>
            <div> prototype 3 </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Usability Test</h3>
          <p>Test with the wireframes revealed some major areas to improve on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Users encountered trouble moving from the mobile app to the bike light. They prefer staying on the app while biking.</li>
            <li>Not enough feedback on botht the app and the bike light, users sometimes get confused while traveling. </li>
          </ul>

          <h3> Iterations</h3>
          <p>We focuse improvements on the following two major components: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Spend more time with the user on the onboarding, especially when they are connecting the bike light to the app.</li>
            <li>Redefine the search process to make it more intuitive, less steps.</li>
            <li>Reduce the number of button on the lights, and increase the size</li>
          </ul>
          <img src={img1} />

          <div className='finding-div'><b>Results: </b><br />
           We tested the new design again to a different group of people and the results were way better.

          <h3> Prototype - APP</h3>
          <p>We had a few variations for the Prototype as shown below. One consideration that is more important than the asthetics of the app itself, is the readability of the screen under different light conditions.</p>
          <div className='project-layout-third'>
            <div>
              <img src={img1} /> <br />
              <span><b>Design 1 </b>: a 'green' theme is used as we are hoping to achive a eco travel method. </span>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src={img1} /><br />
              <span><b>Design 2</b>: a 'green' theme is used as we are hoping to achive a eco travel method. </span>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src={img1} /><br />
              <span><b>Design 3</b>: a 'green' theme is used as we are hoping to achive a eco travel method. </span>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p> In the end, we decide to go with design 3 due to its readability even under extreme sun light. For this design,
          the users can grasp the information in the shortest amoutn of time, which is fatal when they are on the road.</p>
          <img src={img1} />
          <p>Following are the tests of the prototype under various light conditions </p>
          <img src={img1} />

          <h3>Reflections </h3>
          <p> <b>Sometimes the perfect solution is not one, but multiple approaches</b> <br />
          If we have not done the user test and market analysis, we were Automatically assumed to go with one of the two
          completely different method for the problem we are presented. By adapting the UX research process we were able to focus on our users, coming up with
          valid solutions for the problems insead of making assumptions for the sake of building a tool.</p>
          <p><b>Being able to pick up new skills and learn quickly is part of the UX.</b> This probject was done with limited time and resources. at times I had
          to learn new softwares, pick up technical skills along the way. This is not only helpful to me personaly, but it broadens my pespective as an UX design,
          where I was able to develop empathy for other field of personnels.
